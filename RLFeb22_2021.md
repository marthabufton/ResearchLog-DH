February 22, 2021: Background to current digital humanities research project

I have started this research journal/log a bit late. Why? I think partly because I didn’t seem to have the mental or emotional energy to make time for it. Not only am I taking this course, but I am supervising three students, keeping up with my regular teaching and collections duties, and writing award and grant submissions. Plus, I have been divesting myself of my key professional service role (editing the Ontario Library Association magazine), and trying to have a personal life as well. Being a scholar is not for the faint of heart.

However, I’ve decided that I am going to try and write something every week. Maybe I will save up the writing till the end of the week, maybe I will try and write a bit every day so that I can accomplish two of the writing commitments for this course simultaneously. Regardless, I have decided that I will write about the digital humanities project that currently I am leading. I think this will be as much a journal about how I feel as a log of what I am doing … but so be it.

And I want to do a bit of a history, to contextualize what I write between now and April. So this first week will be about how I got to where I’m at the in the project (half optimistic, half anxious), with three people counting on me to lead towards a common goal, and with some ideas that actually seem creative, practical, and feasible.

This first entry is long … but, of course, I am recalling research work I have doing for almost a year.

- I am currently the lead on a digital humanities project. I have three students working with me. I’ve decided to write (at least) weekly about this project between now and the end of term. This timeframe works well, because two of the students will all finish their work on the project within the same time period. The other will finish the third week of May.

- I began planning this project last summer (2020), as I had to write a proposal for a co-op student position. Initially, my goal for the project was very broad and rather fuzzy: To understand digital humanities well enough to be able to select books for the collection and to do some teaching in the program.

While a colleague had been responsible for doing providing minimal support--collection development--for two or three years, as yet no one had formally been assigned to support digital humanists so my work would “break new ground.”
Since 2018, I had been trying to build relationships with the two faculty members most publicly associated with the project--Brian Greenspan in the Department of English and Shawn Graham in the Department of History.

- I was trying to understand both digital humanities and games--both were in my portfolio--and feeling quite overwhelmed and anxious about these responsibilities. I had met had a couple of meetings one with Brian and Sarah Thorne (then a PhD student in English) along with some library colleagues. The focus of this first meeting was just digital humanities.

- About a year later (2019), I had another meeting with Brian, Shawn, some library colleagues and Jenna Stidwill. In this latter meeting, I had both games and digital humanities on the agenda. I had three big takeaways at the end of the conversation: One, I needed to uncouple digital humanities and games--these subjects are quite differen; two, I wanted to focus on digital humanities and needed to tell my department head that I could no longer keep games in my portfolio; and three, that I might be able to work with Jenna Stidwill on a project that could help me wrap my head around digital humanities. I already had a sense that it was “a beast with a thousand tentacles,” i.e., are area of scholarly work that was perhaps difficult to define and in which faculty and students were doing a wide variety of scholarly projects.

Jenna seemed like a perfect research partner. She has a PhD in Cultural Mediations and Brian had been her supervisor, so she already had a much clearer idea of what digital humanities “is.” She’s is also a Carleton contract instructor, which means I might be able to teach with her and try out ideas, and she is doing a library science degree, so has an interest in the role that library staff can play in supporting digital humanists.

I remember feeling optimistic about having someone to work with, particularly because I often feel lonely in my work. And, in the case of digital humanities, I did not have enough of a background in “computing” to feel confident enough to know even where to start with support for digital humanities. And one thing was clear to me: I would need more of a computing background or at least opportunities to work with folks who did and I would have to look outside the library for these folks. Our technical services team is unavailable as is our cataloguing team (which links to being able to run a metadata workshop).
